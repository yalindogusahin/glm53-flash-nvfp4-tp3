# DFlash2 overlay for radixark/vllm-glm53-flash:sm121-v8

Port of vLLM upstream PR #52816 ("[Spec Decode] DFlash2: local convolution +
candidate selector", merged 2026-08-21, merge commit `b389ac294`, head
`3406ec1da`) onto the image's vLLM `0.1.dev20051+g487ecf187` (~Aug 15 tree,

Dockerfile sketch:

```dockerfile
FROM radixark/vllm-glm53-flash:sm121-v8
ARG VLLM=/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/vllm
COPY qwen3_dflash2.py $VLLM/model_executor/models/qwen3_dflash2.py
COPY dflash2/ $VLLM/v1/worker/gpu/spec_decode/dflash2/
COPY patch_registry_and_select.py /opt/patches/
RUN python3 /opt/patches/patch_registry_and_select.py
# (plus patch_glm_aux_capture.py, produced separately)
```

The patch script is idempotent (safe to re-run), anchors every edit with
`assert`, and `ast.parse`s each file before writing. Optional argv[1]
overrides the vllm root (used for testing).

## What the patch script edits (all marked `# SM121-PORT`)

1. `model_executor/models/registry.py` — adds
   `"DFlash2DraftModel": ("qwen3_dflash2", "DFlash2Qwen3ForCausalLM")`
   right after the `DFlashDraftModel` entry (line ~630).
2. `v1/worker/gpu/spec_decode/__init__.py` — inside the `method == "dflash"`
   branch of `init_speculator`, routes to `DFlash2Speculator` when the draft
   declares architecture `DFlash2DraftModel` **or** its `dflash_config`
   carries `selector_rank` (extension over the PR, which checks only the
   architecture).
3. `model_executor/models/qwen3_dflash.py` — the PR's subclass hooks:
   `DFlashQwen3Model.decoder_layer_cls`, `DFlashQwen3ForCausalLM.model_cls`,
   and their use sites; plus the `_dflash_layer_causal` fix, **extended** to
   also read `dflash_config["is_causal"]` — the GLM53 drafter checkpoint puts
   `is_causal: false` inside `dflash_config`, which neither the image's
   `causal` key nor the PR's top-level `getattr(config, "is_causal")` would
   see.
4. `v1/worker/gpu/spec_decode/speculator.py` — `draft_logits_spec()` hook and
   the `torch.full` allocation in `DraftModelSpeculator.__init__`, verbatim
   PR. Needed so DFlash2's fp32/-inf sparse draft-logits cache takes effect
   under `draft_sample_method="probabilistic"`. Default behavior for every
   other speculator is unchanged (head_dtype, fill 0.0 — zeros as before).
5. `config/vllm.py` — `_is_dflash2_draft()` + force `use_v2_model_runner`
   for a DFlash2 draft (same signals as the selection in item 2), verbatim
   PR otherwise. Anchored after `_dflash_needs_multi_kv_group()`; the fork's
   local GLM5-Next `hc_mult` edits in the same file are untouched.
6. `model_executor/layers/logits_processor.py` — `_flashinfer_topk`, `_topk`,
   and `LogitsProcessor.get_top_k_tokens`, verbatim from the merged PR (the
   image's file is byte-identical to the PR base, so this is a pure
   addition). The image's flashinfer ships `top_k(input, k, sorted=...,
   deterministic=...)` with exactly the signature the PR calls — verified.

## Overlay-file adaptations vs upstream

- `qwen3_dflash2.py` — **verbatim** merged upstream file, no changes.
- `dflash2/__init__.py` — verbatim (license header only).
- `dflash2/speculator.py` — one adaptation: the import
  `from vllm.v1.worker.gpu.sample.gumbel import gumbel_noised_argmax` is
  replaced by a local `@triton.jit gumbel_noised_argmax` copied verbatim from
  the merged `gumbel.py`, importing `tl_rand32`/`tl_rand64` from the image's
  `gumbel.py` and `tldevice` from `vllm.triton_utils`. Reason: PR #52816
  factored that helper out of `gumbel_block_argmax`; the image's `gumbel.py`
  predates the refactor, and it is shared with the production GLM/MTP
  sampling path, so it is left untouched. Same rand primitives means the
  draft walk and target verification draw identical noise.

## Drift checked between the image (g487ecf187 + fork edits) and merge b389ac294

- `dflash/speculator.py`: upstream added DCP/context-parallel plumbing and
  null-block guards after the image was built. `DFlash2Speculator` overrides
  only `_generate_draft` and `draft_logits_spec`; the image's
  `_generate_draft` signature matches the PR's exactly, and every attribute
  DFlash2 touches (`sample_pos`, `sample_idx_mapping`, `sample_indices`,
  `temperature`, `seeds`, `draft_tokens`, `use_fp64_gumbel`, `input_buffers`,
  `num_query_per_req`, `draft_logits`) exists with the same shape/meaning.
  The image fills `sample_idx_mapping` with -1 in `capture()` (upstream later
  moved that to the allocation), so padded rows are inert during CUDA graph
  capture as the DFlash2 kernels require.
- `spec_decode/speculator.py`: the fork carries local GLM5-Next `hc_mult`
  edits above the anchored region; anchors avoid them.
- `gumbel.py`: upstream also changed `logits_cache_stride` to two strides;
  for DFlash2's contiguous `[max_num_reqs, steps, vocab]` cache,
  `stride_1 == vocab_size`, so the image's single-stride indexing is
  equivalent. Not ported.
- `qwen3_dflash.py`: upstream additionally grew `is_neox_style` plumbing
  (`dflash_target_rope_is_neox_style`) and a mapper-based `load_weights`;
  both are orthogonal and not ported — the image's `skip_substrs`-based
  loader with the `"model." + name` prefix will route the new
  `layers.N.{attention_conv,mlp_conv}.*` and `candidate_selector.*` weights
  through `AutoWeightsLoader` into the matching module paths.
- Method detection: the image's `SpeculativeConfig` maps any draft model
  path containing "dflash" to `method="dflash"` (a "dflash2"-named path
  matches), and its `EAGLEConfig` leaves `DFlash2DraftModel` unrenamed
  (starts with "DFlash"). Passing `"method": "dflash"` explicitly in
  `--speculative-config` is still the safe move.

## Drafter checkpoint expectations (already on the nodes)

`architectures=["DFlash2DraftModel"]`, model_type qwen3, 5 layers, hidden
4096, vocab 154880, `dflash_config`: block_size 8, conv_kernel_size 2,
conv_group_size 16, mask_token_id 154856, selector_rank 256,
selector_top_k 16, target_layer_ids [5,14,24,33,42], is_causal false,
sliding_window 2048. No embed_tokens / lm_head (borrowed from target).

- `block_size 8` must equal `1 + num_speculative_tokens` → launch with
  `num_speculative_tokens: 7`.
- `conv_group_size 16` divides hidden 4096 → 256 groups; kernel_projection is
  4096 → 2*2*256.
- The selector codebooks are `[154880, 256]` fp16/bf16 ≈ 158 MB total —
  budget for it in the 24G/rank KV split.

## Remaining risks

1. **Aux hidden-state capture on the GLM target** (`target_layer_ids
   [5,14,24,33,42]`) is NOT handled here — that is
   `patch_glm_aux_capture.py`, produced by the other agent. Without it the
   drafter gets no target features and load/serve will fail or degrade.
2. **lm_head / embed_tokens borrowing**: the checkpoint ships neither; the
   image's existing DFlash target-sharing path must attach the GLM lm_head
   and embeddings to the draft. That path predates this port and worked for
   DFlash1-style heads; it has not been exercised with a 154880-vocab GLM
   target + qwen3-arch draft here. First real launch will prove it.
3. **CUDA graph capture of the selector**: the walk and cache kernels run
   eagerly per step outside the captured model graph, as upstream designed.
   The image's `DFlashCudaGraphManager` predates the PR; upstream did not
   change it for DFlash2, so capture should hold, but watch the first
   capture phase for shape/assert errors.
4. **`support_torch_compile` on `CandidateSelector`**: the image's decorator
   falls back to `get_current_vllm_config()` when the class takes no
   `vllm_config` — verified present — but compile-cache tagging
   (`set_model_tag("dflash2_candidate_selector")`) is exercised at load time;
   if the compile pass trips on SM121, drop the `@support_torch_compile`
   line in `qwen3_dflash2.py` (costs ~0.05 ms/step, eager selector).
5. **fp32 draft-logits cache size**: with `draft_sample_method=
   "probabilistic"`, the cache is `max_num_reqs * 7 * 154880 * 4` bytes
   (≈ 4.3 GB at max_num_reqs=1024, ≈ 0.4 GB at 96). Cap `--max-num-seqs`
   accordingly, or serve greedy drafts (no cache) first.
6. The verify-side rejection reads the cache through the image's
   `gumbel_block_argmax` (single-stride variant) — equivalent for the
   contiguous cache, but it is the one semantic seam between the two trees;
   if acceptance at T>0 looks broken while T=0 is fine, look here first.

## Verification performed

- `ast.parse` clean on all three overlay files and all six patched files.
- Patch script applied against a byte-exact mirror of the image's six files:
  all anchors found, unique, idempotent on re-run.
- In-container test (files copied into site-packages of a throwaway
  `--rm` container, patch script run for real):
  `import vllm.model_executor.models.registry`,
  `qwen3_dflash2`, `dflash2.speculator`, `spec_decode.__init__`,
  `config.vllm`, `LogitsProcessor.get_top_k_tokens` presence, and registry
  resolution of `DFlash2DraftModel` — see the session report.
